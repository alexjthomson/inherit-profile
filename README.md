# ‚öôÔ∏è Inherit Profile
Enables profile inheritance in VisualStudio Code!

---

## üìù Configuration
Make sure you have this extension installed on the profile you would like to
inherit settings onto.

__Important__: After updating the inheritance configuration for your profile,
you need to run the `Apply Profile Inheritance (Current Profile)` command. This
will fetch the inherited settings from your chosen profiles. By default this
will automatically execute every time you change profile and every time the
extension starts.

### Inheriting from the Default Profile
`settings.json`
```json
{
    "inheritProfile.parents": ["Default"]
}
```

### Inheriting from Multiple Profiles
`settings.json`
```json
{
    "inheritProfile.parents": ["Default", "My Other Profile"]
}
```

### Full Configuration
`settings.json`
```json
{
    "inheritProfile": {
        "parents": ["Default"],
        "runOnStartup": true,
        "runOnProfileChange": true,
        "showMessages": false
    }
}
```

## üéØ Future Plans
- [ ] Tidy up [`profiles.ts`](src/profiles.ts).
- [ ] Implement extension inheritance. This should be disabled by default, but
  should be possible to enable through configuration.
